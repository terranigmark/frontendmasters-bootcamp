    My name is Héctor Vega, I was born and raised in La Paz, Baja California Sur but currently living in Bogotá, Colombia.
    I was born the 20th of July in 1989, so I'm a 90s kid who enjoyed (still) playing videogames.
    Right now I work as a QA Automation Engineer using Python and JavaScript as programming languages.

  <p>
    I'm interested in learning web development since everything is connected to the web and we use it everyday which means a big chance to work in technology. Another reason is that I always tried to learn fronted development but failed at it... So I want to change that once and for all.
